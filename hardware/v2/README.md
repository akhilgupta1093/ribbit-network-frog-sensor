The hardware [Bill of Materials is located here.](ribbit_network_frog_sensor_bom.csv)

We also have an on-going effort, and are currently in need of help, creating different versions of the Bill of Materials that are localized to different regions.  International BOMs can be stored in this [Folder](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/tree/main/hardware/v2/international_boms).  We welcome any new contributions!
